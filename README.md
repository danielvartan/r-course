## Overview

This repository hosts the slides and materials for an introductory [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming course developed for the Center for Metropolitan Studies ([CEM](https://centrodametropole.fflch.usp.br/)) at the University of São Paulo ([USP](https://www5.usp.br/)).

The slides are available [here](https://danielvartan.github.io/r-course/).

## Usage

The slides are built with the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing system and the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language. The [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package manages the R environment to ensure reproducibility.

After installing these three dependencies, follow these steps to reproduce the results:

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open** the project in your preferred [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).
3. **Restore the R environment** by running [`renv::restore()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/restore.htreportml) in the R console.
4. **Open** `index.qmd` and run the code as described.

## Rendering

After installing all dependencies (see the [Usage](#usage) section), run the following command in the terminal from the project's root directory:

```bash
quarto render
```

This will start the rendering process, which may take some time depending on your machine. Once complete, the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) presentation will be available in the [`docs`](docs) folder.
