## Module 7: Exercise

This notebook corresponds to the 7th module of the course [An Introduction to the R Programming Language](https://github.com/danielvartan/r-course) made for the Sustentarea Research and Extension Group at the University of São Paulo.

## Question

This analysis seeks to address the following question:

::: {style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: bold; color: #ED6B4D; padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em;"}
Was there a **meaningful** difference in ultra-processed food consumption among Brazilian children aged 2 to 4 in 2022 across the clusters of the Revised Multidimensional Index for Sustainable Food Systems ([MISFS-R](https://doi.org/10.1002/sd.2376))?

## Methods

### Approach and Procedure Method

This study employed the hypothetical-deductive method, also known as the method of conjecture and refutation (Popper, 1979), as its problem-solving approach. Procedurally, it applied an enhanced version of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), grounded on the original ideas of Neyman-Pearson framework for data testing (Neyman & Pearson, 1928a, 1928b; Perezgonzalez, 2015).

The analysis was conducted using [General Linear Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_model) alongside visual inspections of the data.

### Source of Data/Information

The data used in this analysis were sourced from Brazil's Food and Nutrition Surveillance System ([SISVAN](https://sisaps.saude.gov.br/sisvan/)), regarding the dataset on ultra-processed food consumption (Sistema de Vigilância Alimentar e Nutricional, n.d.).

Only data from municipalities with **10 or more** monitored children were considered in the analysis.

### Data Wrangling

Data wrangling and analysis followed the data science workflow outlined by (Wickham et al., 2023), as illustrated in [@fig-wickham-at-al-2024-figure-1]. All processes were made using the R programming language (R Core Team, n.d.), RStudio IDE (Posit Team, n.d.), and several R packages.

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) peer-reviewed package ecosystem and other R packages adherents of the tidy tools manifesto (Wickham, 2014, 2023) were prioritized. All processes were made in order to provide result reproducibility and to be in accordance with the FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016).

The Tidyverse [code style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) and [design principles](https://design.tidyverse.org/) were followed to ensure consistency and enhance readability.

All analyses are fully reproducible and can be rerun at any time.

### Hypothesis Testing

We tested whether the means of ultra-processed food consumption among Brazilian children aged 2 to 4 in 2022 differed meaningfully across the clusters of the Revised Multidimensional Index for Sustainable Food Systems (MISFS-R).

To ensure practical significance, we applied a Minimum Effect Size (MES) criterion, following the original Neyman-Pearson framework for hypothesis testing (Neyman & Pearson, 1928a, 1928b; Perezgonzalez, 2015). The MES was set at Cohen's threshold for small effects (Cohen's $d$: $0.2$; Cohen's $f$: $0.1$) (Cohen, 1988). Thus, a difference was considered meaningfully only if its effect-size exceeded the MES; otherwise, it was considered negligible.

The test was structured as follows:

- **Null Hypothesis** ($\text{H}_{0}$): Ultra-processed food consumption among Brazilian children aged 2 to 4 in 2022 does not differ meaningfully across MISFS-R clusters, indicated by Cohen's $f$ effect-size statistic being smaller than or equal to $0.1$ (negligible) **or** by a non-significant F-test (with a Type I error probability ($\alpha$) of $0.05$).

- **Alternative Hypothesis** ($\text{H}_{a}$): Ultra-processed food consumption among Brazilian children aged 2 to 4 in 2022 differs meaningfully across MISFS-R clusters, indicated by Cohen's $f$ effect-size statistic being greater than $0.1$ (non-negligible) **and** by a significant F-test (with a Type I error probability ($\alpha$) of $0.05$).

Formally:

$$
\begin{cases}
\text{H}_{0}: \text{Cohen's} \ f \leq \text{MES} \quad \text{or} \quad \text{F-test is not significant} \ (\alpha \geq 0.05) \\
\text{H}_{a}: \text{Cohen's} \ f > \text{MES} \quad \text{and} \quad \text{F-test is significant} \ (\alpha < 0.05)
\end{cases}
$$

### Interpretation of Results

#### Revised Multidimensional Index for Sustainable Food Systems (MISFS-R)

The MISFS is a tool designed to assess the sustainability of food systems at a subnational level in Brazil, incorporating local behaviors and practices. The MISFS-R is a revised version that introduces new indicators and a refined methodology for calculating the index ([@fig-norde-2023-figure-6]). For more details, see Carvalho et al. (2021) and Norde et al. (2023).

#### Practical Significance

To ensure practical significance, we used Cohen's $f$ statistic small size benchmark as a reference. This statistic was analyzed considering a confidence interval of $95\%$.

We emphasize the need for the use of a MES while conducting hypothesis tests, since a p-value does not measure effect size; rather, it represents the conditional probability of observing the test statistic (or a more extreme value) given that the null hypothesis is true (Cohen, 1994; Wasserstein & Lazar, 2016). As Cohen (1988) put it:

> What is really intended by the invalid affirmation of a null hypothesis is not
that the population ES is literally zero, **but rather that it is negligible, or
trivial**. (Cohen, 1988, p. 16).

> [...] in many circumstances, all that is intended by "proving" the null hypothesis is that the ES [Effect Size] is not necessarily zero but **small enough to be negligible**. (Cohen, 1988, p. 461).

> SMALL EFFECT SIZE: $f^2 = .02$. Translated into $\text{R}^{2}$ or partial $\text{R}^{2}$ for Case 1, this gives $.02 / (1 + .02) = .0196$. We thus define a small effect as one that accounts for 2% of the $\text{Y}$ variance (in contrast with 1% for $r$), and translate to an $\text{R} = \sqrt{0196} = .14$ (compared to .10 for $r$). This is a modest enough amount, **just barely escaping triviality** and (alas!) all too frequently in practice represents the true order of magnitude of the effect being tested [@cohen1988a, p. 413].
