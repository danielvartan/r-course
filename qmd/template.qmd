## Overview

This report presents a data analysis exercise for the course [An Introduction to the R Programming Language](https://github.com/danielvartan/r-course).

The analysis explores potential differences in ultra-processed food consumption among Brazilian children aged 2 to 4 in 2022, focusing on clusters B and D of the Revised Multidimensional Index for Sustainable Food Systems ([MISFS-R](https://doi.org/10.1002/sd.2376)).

**This exercise is for educational purposes only**.

The data requires additional cleaning and validation to ensure its suitability for real-world applications. This analysis assumes the data is valid and reliable, which may not necessarily hold true.

Furthermore, the assumptions underlying the statistical tests were not explicitly verified. For simplicity, it was presumed that the data satisfies all necessary assumptions. Consequently, the validity of the statistical test results may be compromised.

## Question

This analysis seeks to address the following question:

::: {style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1em; padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px;"}
Was there a [**meaningful**]{.brand-red} difference in [**ultra-processed food consumption**]{.brand-red} among Brazilian children aged [**2 to 4**]{.brand-red} in [**2022**]{.brand-red} across the [**clusters B and D**]{.brand-red} of the Revised Multidimensional Index for Sustainable Food Systems ([MISFS-R](https://doi.org/10.1002/sd.2376))?
:::

MISFS is a multidimensional index designed to assess the sustainability of food systems at a subnational level in Brazil, incorporating local behaviors and practices. The MISFS-R is a revised version that introduces new indicators and a refined methodology ([@fig-norde-2023-figure-6]). For more details, see @carvalho2021a and @norde2023.

## Methods

### Approach and Procedure Method

This study employed the hypothetical-deductive method, also known as the method of conjecture and refutation [@popper1979a, p. 164], as its problem-solving approach. Procedurally, it applied an enhanced version of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), grounded on the original ideas of Neyman-Pearson framework for data testing [@neyman1928; @neyman1928a; @perezgonzalez2015].

### Source of Data/Information

The data used in this analysis were sourced from Brazil's Food and Nutrition Surveillance System ([SISVAN](https://sisaps.saude.gov.br/sisvan/)), regarding the dataset on ultra-processed food consumption [@sisvanb].

Only data from municipalities with 10 or more monitored children were considered in the analysis.

### Data Wrangling

Data munging and analysis followed the data science workflow outlined by @wickham2023e, as illustrated in [@fig-wickham-at-al-2024-figure-1]. All processes were made using the R programming language [@rcoreteama], RStudio IDE [@positteama], and several R packages.

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) peer-reviewed package ecosystem and other R packages adherents of the tidy tools manifesto [@wickham2023c] were prioritized. All processes were made in order to provide result transparency and reproducibility.

:::

The Tidyverse [code style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) and [design principles](https://design.tidyverse.org/) were followed to ensure consistency and enhance readability.

All the analyses are 100% reproducible and can be run again at any time. See the [README](hhttps://github.com/danielvartan/r-course-exercise/blob/main/README.md) file in the code repository to learn how to run them.

### Data Analysis

The analysis employed a bilateral [t-test for independent groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test) using a randomization-based empirical null distribution. Visual inspections of the data were also conducted to explore and assess patterns. Furthermore, a power analysis and effect-size estimation were performed to evaluate the statistical robustness and practical significance of the findings.

### Hypothesis Testing

We tested whether the means of ultra-processed food consumption among Brazilian children aged 2 to 4 in 2022 differed meaningfully across the clusters B and D of the Revised Multidimensional Index for Sustainable Food Systems (MISFS-R).

To ensure practical significance, we applied a Minimum Effect Size (MES) criterion, following the original Neyman-Pearson framework for hypothesis testing [@neyman1928; @neyman1928a; @perezgonzalez2015]. The MES was set at Cohen's threshold for small effects (Cohen's $d$ = 0.2) [@cohen1988a]. Thus, a difference was considered meaningfully only if its effect-size was greater or equal to the MES; otherwise, it was considered negligible.

The test was structured as follows:

- **Null Hypothesis** ($\text{H}_{0}$): Ultra-processed food consumption among Brazilian children aged 2 to 4 in 2022 does not differ meaningfully across MISFS-R clusters B and D, indicated by Cohen's $d$ effect-size statistic being smaller than 0.2 (negligible).

- **Alternative Hypothesis** ($\text{H}_{a}$): Ultra-processed food consumption among Brazilian children aged 2 to 4 in 2022 differs meaningfully across MISFS-R clusters B and D, indicated by Cohen's $d$ effect-size statistic being greater or equal than 0.2 (non-negligible).

Formally:

$$
\begin{cases}
\text{H}_{0}: \text{Cohen's} \ d < \text{MES} \\
\text{H}_{a}: \text{Cohen's} \ d \geq \text{MES}
\end{cases}
$$

To ensure validity, this hypothesis test is conditioned on a Type I error ($\alpha$) of 0.05 and a minimum statistical power (1 - $\beta$) of 0.8. This means the test should have at least an 80% probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false, thereby minimizing the risk of a Type II error ($\beta$).
