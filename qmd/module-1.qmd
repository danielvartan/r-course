## Let's Start from Zero {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column style="width: 50%;"}
**This is a programming course**.

As such, we must understand the basics of how a computer works.

It is essential to start from materiality; otherwise, things stop making sense.

If you understand R at its core, you can navigate any challenge you encounter.

**The science of information processes and their interactions with the world** [@denning2005].

Computer science studies information processes both artificial and natural [@denning2005]. It seeks to build a scientific foundation
for such topics as *computer design*, *computer programming*, *information processing*, *algorithmic solutions of problems*, and *the algorithmic process itself* [@brookshear2020].

An [**algorithm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) is a set of steps that defines how a task is performed.

A representation of an algorithm is called a [**program**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program).

The process of developing a program, encoding it in machine-compatible form, and inserting it into a machine is called [**programming**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), or sometimes [**coding**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming).

Programs, and the algorithms they represent, are collectively referred to as [**software**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software), in contrast to the machinery itself, which is known as [**hardware**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware).

- "As the name suggests, the imperative paradigm defines the programming process to be the development of a sequence of commands that, when followed, manipulate data to produce the desired result." [@brookshear2020, p. 327]
- "In contrast to the imperative paradigm is the declarative paradigm, which asks a programmer to describe the problem to be solved rather than an algorithm to be followed. More precisely, a declarative programming system applies a preestablished general-purpose problem-solving algorithm to solve problems presented to it." [@brookshear2020, p. 327]
- "Another programming paradigm is the functional paradigm. Under this
paradigm a program is viewed as an entity that accepts inputs and produces
outputs." [@brookshear2020, p. 327]

## Why R? {.smaller .nostretch}

R is an excellent language to get started with programming because it's specialized. Unlike some other languages, it doesn't have an overwhelming amount of features for you to learn.
