The Multidimensional Index for Sustainable Food Systems (MISFS) is a tool designed to assess the sustainability of food systems at a subnational level in Brazil, incorporating local behaviors and practices.

The **MISFS-R** is a revised version that introduces new indicators and a refined methodology for calculating the index.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è {.smaller}

**This exercise is for educational purposes only**.

The data used in this exercise requires further cleaning and validation to ensure its suitability for real-world applications. For the purposes of this analysis, we will assume the data is valid and reliable, though this assumption may not hold in practice.

Additionally, we will not verify the assumptions underlying the statistical test. To simplify the exercise, we will proceed as though all necessary assumptions are satisfied.

Please note that **the results of the statistical test may not be valid** due to these simplifications.

In real-world scenarios, always ensure that the assumptions of statistical tests are rigorously checked and validated before interpreting the results.
