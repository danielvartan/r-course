  abstract = {Advanced R helps you understand how R works at a fundamental level. It is designed for R programmers who want to deepen their understanding of the language, and programmers experienced in other languages who want to understand what makes R different and special. This book will teach you the foundations of R; three fundamental programming paradigms (functional, object-oriented, and metaprogramming); and powerful techniques for debugging and optimising your code. By reading this book, you will learn: - The difference between an object and its name, and why the distinction is important - The important vector data structures, how they fit together, and how you can pull them apart using subsetting - The fine details of functions and environments - The condition system, which powers messages, warnings, and errors - The powerful functional programming paradigm, which can replace many for loops - The three most important OO systems: S3, S4, and R6 - The tidy eval toolkit for metaprogramming, which allows you to manipulate code and control evaluation - Effective debugging techniques that you can deploy, regardless of how your code is run - How to find and remove performance bottlenecks The second edition is a comprehensive update: - New foundational chapters: "Names and values," "Control flow," and "Conditions" - Comprehensive coverage of object oriented programming with chapters on S3, S4, R6, and how to choose between them - Much deeper coverage of metaprogramming, including the new tidy evaluation framework - Use of new package like rlang (rlang.r-lib.org), which provides a clean interface to low-level operations, and purr (purrr.tidyverse.org/) for functional programming - Use of color in code chunks and figures},

  abstract = {Use R to turn data into insight, knowledge, and understanding. With this practical book, aspiring data scientists will learn how to do data science with R and RStudio, along with the tidyverseâ??a collection of R packages designed to work together to make data science fast, fluent, and fun. Even if you have no programming experience, this updated edition will have you doing data science quickly. You'll learn how to import, transform, and visualize your data and communicate the results. And you'll get a complete, big-picture understanding of the data science cycle and the basic tools you need to manage the details. Updated for the latest tidyverse features and best practices, new chapters show you how to get data from spreadsheets, databases, and websites. Exercises help you practice what you've learned along the way.},
